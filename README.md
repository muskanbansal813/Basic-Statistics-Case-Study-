# Basic-Statistics-Case-Study
Analyze business problems through hypothesis testing and statistical analysis to drive data-informed decisions.

## Project Overview
This case study aims to address five unique business problems using statistical hypothesis testing. By leveraging statistical methods, we can provide data-driven insights and solutions to these business challenges. Each problem will be solved through careful hypothesis formulation, testing, and result interpretation.

## Objective
The goal of this case study is to apply hypothesis testing methods to solve specific business questions. Hypothesis testing helps in making informed decisions by comparing data against assumed conditions (null hypotheses) and evaluating the likelihood of observed outcomes.

## Methodology
#### Step 1: Define Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): State the null hypothesis for each problem.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): State the alternative hypothesis.

#### Step 2: Select the Appropriate Test
Based on the data type and business question, select the statistical test:
1. **t-test:** For comparing means between two groups.
2. **ANOVA:** For comparing means across multiple groups.
3. **Chi-Square Test:** For testing independence between categorical variables.
4. **Correlation Test:** To determine relationships between variables.

#### Step 3: Perform Hypothesis Testing
Use Python libraries such as scipy.stats to execute the hypothesis tests. Determine the p-value to decide if the null hypothesis can be rejected or not, using a significance level of 0.05.

#### Step 4: Interpretation of Results
Interpret the p-values and statistical outcomes to draw conclusions for each business problem.
